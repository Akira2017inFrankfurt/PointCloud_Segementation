2. Absorb the basic information with mindmap, summarize the structures, record where incomprehension happens and problems;
3. Start to implement all the useful codes of deep learning networks, summarize and come up to my own opinions;
4. Try to test these thoughts and make progress.


###Papers include:

0 - Introduction
1 - Pointnets
2 - CNNs
3 - Autoencoder based deep learning
4 - Others
